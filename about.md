## About me
Short about me I am a 25 year old man from Stockholm. I have worked at a central warehouse and as a sales rep at different companies. During my education IHM I have
learned about Google Analytics 4 where I got a Certification, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, GDPR and Google Tag Manager. 

In the upcoming courses I will learn more about advanced Digital Analytics, Statistics and conversion optimization. 

I am curious as a person and always looking forward to new challenges and new opportunies to learn.
